tjhayasaka's iRacing setups
===========================

This is my own set of iRacing setups, mainly of dirt sprint cars.

It is made and tailored for me to drive easier (not faster), and provided just for your information.
Don't expect that you can drive faster using it.  See "Other Setup Resources" section for better setups.

Who am I?
---------

  - Living in iRacing as "Tomoaki Hayasaka".
  - DISCLAIMER:  My dirt-oval iRating is around 2500 (as of Jul 2021) - not particularly noob, but definitely slow.
  - DISCLAIMER:  I've never driven a car in real life.  I don't have a driver's license.

How To Use
----------

Browse, select and download a setup file ("*.sto" file) you need and move it to your iRacing setup folder (default: `C:/Users/#{yourname}/Documents/iRacing/setups/#{carname}/`).  Sometimes there are multiple files for same track/car.  Last one is latest (and the best for me).

Alternatively, as a matter of course, you can clone this repository too.  Symlink is your friend in this case.

Naming Conventions
------------------

A setup file has a name formatted as:

    setups/#{carname}/AAAA-tjh-#{year}/tjh-#{trackname}-#{year}s#{season}r#{revision}#{supplement}.sto

For example:

    setups/dirtsprint winged 360/AAAA-tjh-2021/tjh-kokomo-2021s03r01-feature.sto

The "AAAA-tjh-#{year}/" part is used personally for ordering (i.e. my setup folders are always on top of the list in the iRacing garage view).

"#{revision}" is a 2-digit revision number starting from 00.
It is incremented when a change is made since last publish.
